Background

Based on existing food production capacity, experts believe we could feed everyone in the world -- if we did a better job managing and distributing it. With the global population expected to reach 9 billion by 2050, the most impoverished regions of the world will be hit hardest by any changes to the climate. Available arable land should be used sensibly and sustain-ably to address the world's food needs. An improved understanding of where our food is grown, and where it ends up, could influence decision making related to food needs. Learning more about where food is grown and distributed on Earth could potentially inform future space explorers on techniques to use during long-duration spaceflights.

Challenge

This is a challenge to identify and visualize the current capacity and potential of countries to be self-sufficient in the provision of food for their populations, and to map how current global food needs are met through reliance on international food trade.

Recent land cover maps (using satellite derived/ crowdsourced data) can be used to estimate the spatial area of cropland. Country level land cover usage data, where available, could be used to categorize and quantify current cropland use including for example: growth of food staples for direct human consumption; cash crops e.g. cocoa or coffee; crops grown for animal feed; pastures used for animal rearing; crops used for fuel/ manufacturing; and wasteland. Along with crop import and export data, this could be a useful tool for improved identification of food needs, and food insecurity stemming from inefficiencies related to land usage and unsustainable trade. In addition to it being an educative interactive tool, with enough inputs it could also be a useful tool for resource management. Following the initial development, this could be worked on in conjunction with statistics orientated institutions and it could provide useful additional information for early warning systems related to food security.

Considerations

This challenge relies on the availability of recent land cover maps and government statistics related to crop yields and export/ import quantities of crops. As a starting point, the focus could be on a few demonstration countries for which the required data is available, with a vision to extending the functionality globally.

This challenge could involve development of a map based application, incorporating the following:
Existing raster layers of land cover data, including arable land/ pastures (there are satellite derived and crowd sourced products available).
A method to quantify land suitable for growing crops within a country's boundaries (or preferably use of existing data if available).
Categorized identification of arable land use in terms of what the end product is used for, e.g.:
growing food staples for human consumption
cash crops e.g. cocoa or coffee
growing crops specifically for animal feed
pastures used for animal rearing
growing crops for the fuel and manufacturing industries
Arable land that is currently unused/ wasteland.
Government statistics (where available) related to overall yields and yields of various crops produced within the country, and the quantities of crops imported and exported (ideally categorized as staple crops/ cash crops/ animal feed/ crops used for fuel etc.)
Development of an interesting way to present the output information, so that each country's food production and food trade patterns can be easily understood. Possibly a template infographic could be used to display the data for each country, or a set of interactive maps showing the intertwining trade between countries.
Citizen science - it would be interesting to incorporate a forum for open discussion, where citizens can discuss current trade practices/ sustainability issues.

Advanced applications could involve:
Development of an index to determine the idealistic potential of each country to be self-sufficient in provision of food for the people living there, based on the population and the availability of arable land.
Development of an index/ assessment approach to determine how sustainable each country's current approach is, based on the sensibility of land use and the import/ export trade.
Mapping of historical variability in these indices.
Incorporation of additional economic/ environmental/ livelihood factors, e.g. crop pricing, vulnerability to climate change, human development index etc.
